⚠️ **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. 

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

Unlike Python-based brute force tools, **WalletGen** is written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, delivering up to **10x faster** performance. Whether you’re exploring lost wallets, verifying private key space, or recovering your own wallet, WalletGen gives you the power to do it efficiently and securely.

## Features

- **Generation of cryptocurrency wallets**: Wallet Gen supports creating single wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC and other cryptocurrencies.
- **Search for wallets with balance**: Using bruteforce techniques, Wallet Gen allows you to search for existing wallets with balances in both the Bitcoin network and EVMs.
- **Support for various algorithms**: Keccak256 algorithm for EVM wallets and BIP39, BIP44, Bech32 algorithm for Bitcoin are used for wallet generation.
- **Using a database to speed up searches**: Download and use databases to search for balance wallets, speeding up the process tenfold.
- **High speed of operation**: Wallet Gen utilizes the power of the CPU and GPU to achieve the best performance.
- **Recovery your Bitcoin wallet**: WalletGen allows you to recover your bitcoin wallet by seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

## Supported Blockchains

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
- Any EVM-compatible chain

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows you to search using brute-force method for two types of crypto wallets with an existing balance.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

* Press key 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets through the internet. This method may take longer, as it checks wallet balances in real-time via blockchain explorers.
* Press key 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database. This method is faster because it compares generated wallets against a pre-built database of known addresses with balances.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

* Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets through the internet. This method checks for wallets with balance in real-time through blockchain explorers.
* Press key 6 to search EVM wallets using the database. This method is faster since it compares generated wallets against the known database of addresses with balance.

### Speed Considerations:

* The speed of the search depends heavily on your hardware, especially the graphics card (GPU). To speed up the process and increase your chances of finding a wallet with a balance, you can run multiple instances of the program (1 to 4), depending on your system's performance

By using the database, you can significantly improve the efficiency of your search, as it eliminates the need to query the blockchain for every wallet generated

## The Program Found a Wallet — What’s Next?
When the program finds a wallet with a balance, it will:
* **Stop** immediately
* **Display** the wallet details in the console
* **Save** this data in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file

### How to Access the Funds?
1. Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into any compatible crypto wallet (such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2. Once restored, you’ll be able to transfer the funds to your own wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen allows you to recover your bitcoin wallet by seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The program supports entering a complete seed phrase, as well as searching for missing words using special characters.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If your seed phrase is missing some words or you are unsure, replace those words with an *. WalletGen will search through all possible variations in the places of * to find the correct seed phrase and restore the associated wallet balance.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

If you have a full 12-word seed, simply enter it in full with a space. WalletGen will generate all address types (Legacy, SegWit, P2SH) and check their balances.

### Important recommendations

* Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
* Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
* Searching for missing words may take considerable time, especially if several words are missing.
* If the wallet with balance is successfully recovered, the program will automatically stop and save the found data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/assets/wallet.png)


I’ve personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).  
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
